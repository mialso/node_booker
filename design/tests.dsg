        test conception and module design doc
    concept:
        [container testing]:
    // container tests on app load
    // one possibility is to meet the initialized object, with exact name as mine app
    // once per container... or every load?
        [ring buffer]:
    // create ring buffer to collect and send error logs to server
    [load]
// that one would collect all errors during load phase
// the buffer would be sent as load tests pass
    [


    module:
        [purpose]:
to help user to 
* test himself
* test interfaces
* test load status
* test static data correctness
* load models
* create random values, using correct and error ranges
* test handlers
* test states
* test performance
    [metaphor]:
the metaphor for this module is human brain. 
abilities:
    imagination     - to create mock data
    analitics       - to compare and make decision
    nervous system  - to collect data from every 'body' part

        [actions]:
test
    init test
        create test case
            create models
                model_ready
            create mocks
                mock_ready
            test_case_ready
        create stubs
            stubs_ready
        test_ready
    perform test
    create result
    output result
